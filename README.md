# Finsweet Developer Starter

A starter template for both Client & Power projects. This project contains:

- Preconfigured development tools:

  - [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A superset of Javascript that adds an additional layer of Typings, bringing more security and efficiency to the written code.
  - [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): Code formating that assures consistency across all Finsweet's projects.
  - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): Code linting that forces industries' best practises.
  - [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/): Javascript bundler that compiles, bundles and minifies the original Typescript files.

- Learning resources for new team members:

  - Learning Typescript: Everything you need to start confidently coding with Typescript.
  - Coding best practises: Learn how to write clean and semantic code that is easily understandable by your teammates.
  - Setting up your development environment: Learn how to set up VSCode and to use the development tools included in this repository

  - Git: Learn how to collaborate with your teammates' code!

## How to start

The quickest way to start developing a new project is by [creating a new repository from this template](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

After that, open the new repository in your terminal and install the NPM packages by running:

```
npm install
```

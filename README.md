# Finsweet Developer Starter

A starter template for both Client & Power projects. This project contains:

- Preconfigured development packages:

  - [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A superset of Javascript that adds an additional layer of Typings, bringing more security and efficiency to the written code.
  - [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): Code formating that assures consistency across all Finsweet's projects.
  - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): Code linting that forces industries' best practises.
  - [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/): Javascript bundler that compiles, bundles and minifies the original Typescript files.
